	* Version 0.7 released.

	* Device handling: Scan devices for partitions already available at
	  startup time. No more USB power hacks required.

	* Device handling: Unmount residual mounts on startup. This change is
	  not relevant for end users, but very relevant during development.

	* Device reporting: USB devices have their correct USB port reported
	  over D-Bus now. Users of the de.tahifi.MounTA.GetAll method and
	  de.tahifi.MounTA.NewUSBDevice signal, respectively, can now make use
	  of this information.

	* Misc: Improve resource management by use of smart pointers, other
	  internal improvements.
