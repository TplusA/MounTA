2019-12-05  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Misc: Fix various compiler warnings.

2019-02-05  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.11 released.

	* Device handling: A D-Bus signal is emitted just before a device is
	  about to be removed. This gives other processes the chance to close
	  any open files on file systems on that device so that device removal
	  can succeed in a clean way.

2018-12-05  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.10 released.

	* Volume handling: Create and remove symlinks with volume labels for
	  use by Gerbera.

	* Volume handling: Use mount option "utf8" for FAT-like file systems.

2018-03-06  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.9 released.

	* Volume handling: File system "iso9660" is recognized. Volumes
	  formatted with that file system don't trigger a (harmless) warning
	  anymore.

	* Misc: Do not error out if markdown is not installed.

2018-01-23  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.8 released.

	* Device handling: Some (most?) devices were not mounted.

2017-12-19  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.7 released.

	* Device handling: Scan devices for partitions already available at
	  startup time. No more USB power hacks required.

	* Device handling: Unmount residual mounts on startup. This change is
	  not relevant for end users, but very relevant during development.

	* Device reporting: USB devices have their correct USB port reported
	  over D-Bus now. Users of the de.tahifi.MounTA.GetAll method and
	  de.tahifi.MounTA.NewUSBDevice signal, respectively, can now make use
	  of this information.

	* Misc: Improve resource management by use of smart pointers, other
	  internal improvements.

2016-07-11  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.6 released.

	* Bux fix: Recognize devices whose internal name begins with "ata-" in
	  addtition to those with names beginning with "usb-".

2016-02-26  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.5 released.

	* Bug fix: Use correct name in syslog messages.

2016-02-12  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.4 released.

	* Bug fix: Avoid log disruption by very long messages.

2015-12-08  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.3 released.

	* Volume handling: Mount vfat and similar simple file systems so that
	  all files and directories are accessible. This is accomplished by
	  using the umask mount option.

	* Volume handling: Adjusted default mount options for security.

2015-12-01  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.2 released.

	* D-Bus interfaces: Fixed some flaws in interface design.

	* D-Bus interfaces: Devices and mounted volumes can be queried by
	  calling the de.tahifi.MounTA.GetAll D-Bus method.

	* Volume handling: Labels are read out with the help of the external
	  blkid tool.

2015-11-17  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.1 released.

	* First release for testing.

	* Limitations: Volume information (labels) are not retrieved. Mounted
	  volumes are not gathered at startup. Retrieval of list of devices
	  and mounted volumes over D-Bus not implemented. Possibly more.

	  This is software in alpha phase.
