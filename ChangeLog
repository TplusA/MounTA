2019-02-05  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.11 released.

	* Device handling: A D-Bus signal is emitted just before a device is
	  about to be removed. This gives other processes the chance to close
	  any open files on file systems on that device so that device removal
	  can succeed in a clean way.

2018-12-05  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Misc: Do not error out if markdown is not installed.

2018-01-23  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

2017-12-19  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.7 released.

	* Device handling: Scan devices for partitions already available at
	  startup time. No more USB power hacks required.

	* Device handling: Unmount residual mounts on startup. This change is
	  not relevant for end users, but very relevant during development.

	* Device reporting: USB devices have their correct USB port reported
	  over D-Bus now. Users of the de.tahifi.MounTA.GetAll method and
	  de.tahifi.MounTA.NewUSBDevice signal, respectively, can now make use
	  of this information.

	* Misc: Improve resource management by use of smart pointers, other
	  internal improvements.

2016-07-11  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.2 released.

	* D-Bus interfaces: Fixed some flaws in interface design.

	* D-Bus interfaces: Devices and mounted volumes can be queried by
	  calling the de.tahifi.MounTA.GetAll D-Bus method.

	* Volume handling: Labels are read out with the help of the external
	  blkid tool.

2015-11-17  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 0.1 released.

	* First release for testing.

	  volumes are not gathered at startup. Retrieval of list of devices
	  and mounted volumes over D-Bus not implemented. Possibly more.

	  This is software in alpha phase.
